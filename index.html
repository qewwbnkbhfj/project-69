                <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p> “To provide value-based education and mould the character of the younger generation through a system of wholesome learning, so that the earnest endeavour to achieve progress and prosperity in life is matched by an ardent desire to extend selfless service to society, one complementing the other.”
                    We strive to provide the best possible education to the students; one that ensures their holistic development and prepares them for life, resulting in good leaders and responsible citizens.

                    Provide the best possible education
                    Amma wants the children to have an education that helps them to develop physically, mentally, socially and spiritually. It is also crucial that they are exposed to India’s vibrant, ancient culture, and are made aware of their inner potential.

                    Provide an education that ensures holistic development and prepare students for life
                    A good education equips children to face life’s challenges and remain calm in all adversities. As Amma says, “Gaining mastery over the mind is the real education.” Children are the world’s wealth, and how we guide and train them will make or mar their future.

                    In ancient times, students were taught what life was really about. They were taught how to live their lives and how to conduct themselves in the world. They developed strong minds and could easily withstand hardships or face obstacles. They were dedicated to Truth and were not afraid of death.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> Create good leaders and responsible citizens
                    Amma wants to transform the youth of India into “lion cubs.” With this in mind, Amrita Vidyalayams all over the country ensure that children develop into their fullest potential. This is made possible by providing students with a positive, stimulating, and caring environment that encourages the fulfilment of individual potential and the growth of self-esteem in academic, social, and personal areas.

                    We believe
                    Nothing can match the blessedness of being an Amrita child, under the care of Amma’s infinite love and compassion. Amrita Vidyalayams are schools based on Amma’s ideology, that in their formative years, children should be allowed to evolve naturally and spontaneously.
                    <br>
                    No experience a child undergoes is inconsequential; each experience leaves a long-lasting impression on its psyche. And to be receptive, the child needs to be relaxed in an ambience of love and affection.

They should spread their fragrance and beauty throughout the world. But everywhere, these flowers are in danger of falling prey to worms before they can fully blossom.

                    <p> We are all aware that school closures due to the pandemic, has handicapped the student’s life all over the world. Not just academics but also their mental, physical and emotional well-being has been hugely affected.<br>

                <center>
                    <p> In response to the present situation, educators have been instrumental in switching over to the completely new platform of Virtual teaching to enable continuity of learning. The video conferencing tool has been a boon through which teachers have been able to meet students regularly which has helped in keeping the teacher-student relationship intact. Moreover this has also made parent-teacher-student collaboration positive and transparent.
                    </p>

                <center><br>
                    <p> By the introduction of Virtual schooling we have stepped on to a new trend of the blended learning model which is gaining popularity. We have to acknowledge that virtual school is not just about taking a lesson through a video conferencing tool; it involves a modular shift in pedagogy. The balance of online and offline tasks is a critical aspect to consider while designing the timetable and lesson plan. Huge efforts have been put by the management and staff to enable this complete shift in the system work successfully at the School level. Even before training the students, we have trained ourselves to provide a smooth and error free experience of learning to the students.<br></p>
                </center><br>

                <center><br>
                    <p> This model has helped learning to continue beyond the four walls of the classroom, allowing students’ choice and flexibility to learn at their pace, creating more opportunities for collaborative tasks along with providing opportunities to rethink the mode of assessments and feedback. Virtual education has opened up possibilities of rethinking the methods of teaching and learning.
                        <br>
                    </p>
                </center>
                <center>
                    <p> We also need to acknowledge that the transition to virtual learning can be challenging for all stakeholders. Parents will have to think differently about how to equip their children in the virtual learning space; how to create structures and routines that allow their children to be successful; and how to support their learning journey while considering the emotional well-being as well. Schools like hospitals are caregivers and we, as a school will fall back on the school framework of Relevance, Relationship and Rigour to support parents in this process of creating meaningful engagement with their children.
                        <br>

                    <p>
                        I think all educators need a pat on their back for their immense efforts and passion towards providing education even during times of such pandemic and at the cost of their own health. As everyone we too are going through the adversities but at the same time are being positive in serving the generation ahead by always being there with them. Your support and co-operation will be much appreciated.</p>
